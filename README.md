## TL;DR
I started solving problems on **20-09-2025** and committed my **first solution** here. My goal is disciplined, daily practice to build problem-solving fluency and interview readiness. This repo tracks that journey: what I learn, how I improve, and concrete milestones.

## My Story
Day 1 felt exciting — beginning a new habit is always a mix of curiosity and challenge. This repo will grow with each commit and reflection, marking consistent progress in my learning journey.

---

## Consistency Plan
- **Daily Minimum:** Solve at least 1 problem or spend 30 minutes learning.  
- **Weekly Target:** 5 problems + 1 review day.  
- **Streak Tracking:** Calendar + repo logs.  
- **Avoiding Burnout:** If I can’t do a full session, I’ll at least review notes.  

Consistency > Intensity. That’s my mantra.

## Learning Process
1. **Understand** the problem in my own words.  
2. **List examples & edge cases.**  
3. **Try brute force first.**  
4. **Optimize solutions.**  
5. **Analyze time & space complexity.**  
6. **Implement clearly and comment code.**  
7. **Test thoroughly.**  
8. **Reflect in notes for future improvement.**
